Using Random Forest to Predict Student Performance
Project Requirements
Your project (from one of topics above) must include the following components.
1. Real-World Problem Introduction
•	Clearly describe a practical problem from industry, science, or everyday life.
•	Explain why the problem is important and what challenges it poses.
•	Provide enough context for readers unfamiliar with the domain.
2. Algorithm Introduction
•	Introduce the algorithm your group selects (for example: Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Binary Search Tree, Dynamic Programming, KMP, Kruskal, Segment Tree, Greedy strategy, etc.).
•	Describe its purpose, structure, and core idea.
•	Present any known theoretical properties such as time complexity, space complexity, and design paradigm.
3. How the Algorithm Solves the Problem
•	Explain step-by-step how the chosen algorithm can be applied to the real-world problem.
•	Justify why this algorithm is suitable for the problem.
•	Highlight advantages such as efficiency, optimality, correctness, or simplicity.
•	If relevant, compare briefly with alternative algorithms and explain why they are less suitable.
4. Future Work
•	Discuss possible improvements or extensions of your solution.
•	Mention limitations of the algorithm or implementation.
•	Suggest directions for further research or real-world deployment.
________________________________________
. Final Report
•	A written report that provides a complete and well-organized description of your project.
•	The report should include motivation, problem statement, algorithm explanation, analysis, experiments (if any), results, future work, and references.

Final Report and Code
The final report must provide a complete and organized description of your project. The evaluation will consider the following:

•	Implementation details, including data structures, logic, and code design
•	Presentation of results or demonstration outputs
•	Analysis and discussion of the results
•	Future work and potential improvements
•	References
